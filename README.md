# 911 Emergency Calls Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes real 911 call data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  
The goal was to explore call patterns, extract important time-based features, compare emergency types, and visualize trends using clear analytics.

The project demonstrates effective data cleaning, feature extraction, grouping, and visual storytelling using Python.

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the full 911 emergency call dataset  
- Extracted new time-based features (Hour, Month, Day of Week, Date)  
- Engineered the “Reason” category (EMS, Fire, Traffic)  
- Identified the most frequent emergency types and locations  
- Visualized call volume trends over months and years  
- Built time series for each emergency type (EMS, Fire, Traffic)  
- Created heatmaps and clustermaps to reveal behavioural patterns  
- Interpreted insights on when and why emergencies occur

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Skills Demonstrated
- Real-world dataset cleaning  
- Feature engineering from timestamps  
- Groupby analysis and pattern detection  
- Heatmaps, clustermaps, and trend visualization  
- Clear communication of insights through graphics

## Project Purpose
To understand patterns in emergency call behaviour and develop strong EDA skills using real public-safety data.  
This project builds experience with time-series feature extraction and high-quality visual analytics.
